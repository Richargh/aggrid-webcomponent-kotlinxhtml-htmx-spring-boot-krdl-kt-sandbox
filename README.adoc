LiveReload is great for fast iteration.
It'll restart spring and refresh your browser window for changes.

To use it:

. In one Terminal start Gradle Continuous Build `./gradlew build -continuous`
. In another Terminal or via IntelliJ run your application via `./gradlew bootRun`
. Open the site in your browser
. If the LiveReload Extension symbol in your browser shows "connected", then your browser will refresh on changes
